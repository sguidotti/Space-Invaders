# Space-Invaders
Scaled Down Version Of Space Invaders
This project was completed in 2017 for a introdution to object oriented programming course.
I decided to push myself and experiment with some design patterns that I had been exploring on my own.
In the future, I would like to come back and update this code to reflect my current abiltiy and make it better in general. 
However, this is still a project that I am proud that I attempted.
